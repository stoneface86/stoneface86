# Welcome

I'm stoneface. I am a hobbyist developer who specializes in low level stuff like operating systems, embedded systems and all
things hardware. I am a student at UNH, working on a bachelors in Computer Engineering.

I'm currently working on a music tracker for the gameboy, [trackerboy](https://github.com/stoneface86/trackerboy). It's my only project at the moment but I do some
side projects with emulation and sound programming every now and then.

I am looking for contributors for trackerboy, contact me if interested.

You can contact me from any of my accounts here:
